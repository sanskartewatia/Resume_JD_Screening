# Resume_JD_Screening
 
This is a simple full-stack project with python backend and html frontend. A hiring person can simply upload 2 pdf files -  applicant's resume and a job profile, and this tool will print a score between 0-10 based on how closely the candidate's experiences and educational background align with the requirements of the role.
